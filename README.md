# OSU AI Bootcamp - Module 18 Challenge - Neural Networking 1
## Submitted by Brandon Allen
## Overview
The premise of this chalenge was that I work at a company that specializes in student loan refinancing. If the company can predict whether a borrower will repay their loan, it can provide a more accurate interest rate for the borrower. My team has asked me to create a model to predict student loan repayment.
The business team has given me a CSV file that contains information about previous student loan recipients. With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a model that will predict the likelihood that an applicant will repay their student loans. The CSV file contains information about these students, such as their credit ranking.
## Files
- student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb is the main Jupyter notebook where the assignment is completed.
- student_loans.keras is the trained model, saved to a file.
